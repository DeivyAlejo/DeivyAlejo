# Hi üññüèº my name is Deivy Munoz
As a multidisciplinary professional with a strong foundation in electronics, software development, and academic research, I bring hands-on experience in failure analysis, embedded systems, and computer vision. Currently at Evertz Microsystems, I troubleshoot complex hardware issues on high-performance broadcast equipment and collaborate on Linux-based diagnostics. My previous work spans backend development in Python and C++, image processing with OpenCV, and engineering education. With a Master's in Electronics Instrumentation and a diploma in Computer Systems, I thrive at the intersection of hardware and software, solving real-world problems through innovation and precision.
