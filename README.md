## More about me
- I am from Colombia but I recently moved to Canada to study Computer Systems.
- I am learning how to fly FPV drones using [Tiny Whoop GO](https://tinywhoopgo.com/) and [this controller](https://newbeedrone.com/products/jumper-t-pro-with-2-4g-1000mw-expresslrs-elrs-internal-module-radio-controller). Shortly I would like to build my mini whoop drone.
- I really like motorcycles. I had motorcycles previously in my home country, and I am pursuing my motorcycle license in Canada. I am considering buying a small motorcycle, like the [Honda Grom](https://powersports.honda.ca/en/minimoto/2024/models?trim=grom_13340).
